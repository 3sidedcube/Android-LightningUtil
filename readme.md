#Storm Library - Module Util

Storm is a collection of libraries that helps make mobile and desktop applications easy to create using a high quality WYSIACATWYG editor.

This module is used as a common dependency between all the storm modules and also contains a set of useful classes/methods

#Usage

You shouldn't need to include this dependency as it will come as part of any module you include, however, you can use this library as a stand-alone utils library.

##Gradle

Simply include the following for your gradle dependencies `com.cube.storm:util:0.3`.

**Note** The versioning of the library will always be as follows:

`Major version.Minor version.Bug fix`

It is safe to use `+` in part of of the `Bug fix` version, but do not trust it 100%. Always use a *specific* version to prevent regression errors.
